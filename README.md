This is my experiment to get:
- simple app to make periodical breaks on my Kubuntu 20.04
- learn Linux GUI apps packaging and distribution
- avoid too heavy apps for simple task

Please don't blame on me for this app. 
My thanks for authors of similar apps ! You inspired me to make this one.

There is scripts/build_linux.sh script to produce AppImage file.
Release part has ready one. But this was built on Kubuntu 20.04 and will require recent versions of runtime libraries.

Please send me questions and requests on dmytro.bogovych (at) gmail.com.
